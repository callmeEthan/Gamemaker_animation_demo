## Introduction
<p align="center">
This is an animation tool that I made for my project. Everything is written in GameMaker Language without any external extension. It should work on any platform (not tested).
</p>

> This is the 7 revision in my attempts to create a perfect animation system for GameMaker in the past few years, from 2D, to 2.5D, to 3D.

There are four primary systems included:
- Editor
- Skeleton
- Model
- Animation

## Alternative
Other 3D animation system you can try!

## Support 
This tool is created by me and for me, provided publicly free of charge, you can use it in your project (free or commercially) at your own discretion, it is made with my limited knowledge in computer animation; some detail/method may be incorrect and unorthodox.  
**I will not take any responsibility or provide any technical support**, however you can hire me for your project implementation and development.
